# Snake-Game
UI Snake Game with High Score Tracking using Python


Introduction:
In this project, I developed a UI snake game using Python and the turtle library. The objective was to create an interactive and visually appealing game where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer. Additionally, I implemented a feature to save the high score data and display it on the screen using the scoreboard and time libraries.

Libraries Used:

Python turtle library: Used for creating graphics and handling user input in a simple and beginner-friendly way.
Snake library: A custom module containing classes and functions to handle the snake's movement, growth, and collision detection.
Food library: A module to generate food items randomly on the screen for the snake to eat.
Scoreboard library: A module to manage the game's score and high score tracking.
Time library: Utilized to control the game's speed and time-related functionalities.


Features Implemented:

Snake Movement: Players can control the snake's movement using arrow keys or other specified controls.
Food Generation: Random food items are generated on the screen, and the snake grows longer each time it eats a food item.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, incrementing it with each food item consumed.
High Score Saving: The game saves the highest score attained, persisting it even after the game is closed.
High Score Display: The high score is displayed on the screen using the scoreboard library, providing a visual representation of the player's best achievement.
